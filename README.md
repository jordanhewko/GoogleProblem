# GoogleProblem

I saw this problem on reddit this past weekend on /r/learnprogramming, you can find the thread [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9vp1vv/an_interesting_problem_from_a_job_interview_at/), the question is stated as:

> Given a list containing integers in (ascending) order, and a target value, can you find a pair of numbers whose sum equals the target number?

For example, with the following list:

> l = [1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 22]

and a target of:

> integer: 16

Can you find a pair within the list that adds to the integer?

Some notes about my solution:

* My solution is in Python. 
* I used command line arguments to randomly generate a list of n elements.
* I searched for the number 120
